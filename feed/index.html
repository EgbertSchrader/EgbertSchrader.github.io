					<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team has been busy flying all around the world this October. We have attended three big mobile industry events – </span><b>Casual Connect Eastern Europe</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Serbia, </span><b>White Nights</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conference in Moscow and </span><b>Game Connection Europe</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Paris. </span></h4>
				</div>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1 et_pb_bg_layout_light  et_pb_text_align_left">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of those three events was special in their own terms, which is why we’ve decided to do a general overview of all of the event’s highlights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First up was </span><a href="http://ee.casualconnect.org/"><b>Casual Connect Eastern Europe</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Serbia’s beautiful capital Belgrade. The event was organized to match the game industry’s creativity with new media, innovation and investment. Many up-and-coming mobile developers were present there and we really enjoyed the modern tech culture that greeted us there with many cutting-edge gaming solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event was full of developers, including many major players and indie developers. Our Business Development Manager, Linh Le Phuong, had her hands full for all three days. Most of the developers were looking for investors to scale up their games, whilst still considering to self-publish their games due to the high cut that the publishing agencies take. We met many developers who were looking to expand their games to China, who noted that they find it difficult to enter this market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to that, we had many successful meetings with new and existing clients. We got to talk about our platform and give monetization tips to our publishers.</span></p>
				</div>

				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap"><img src="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cceserbia_blog.png" alt="" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_bg_layout_light  et_pb_text_align_left">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-October our Managing Director, Sushant Patil and our Business Development Manager, Victoria Bessonova attended </span><a href="https://wnconf.com/en"><b>White Nights Moscow.</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The event gathered together all the biggest players in Russia and featured speakers from companies like Facebook, Appodeal and Twitch. In addition to the glitz and glamour that filled the conference hall and the networking parties, the event itself was also booming of industry specialists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team attended various sessions from Unity, Facebook and Google speakers, as well as talks that discussed the Chinese and Latam markets. They proved to be very informative about where the industry is heading and gave us new ideas on how to improve our platform even further. We had meetings with many of our industry-leading partner networks to strengthen our partnerships and to learn about the updates they are planning to do in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the app developers and different platform representatives, there were also many game developers for PS4 and PC present who do not have any applications at the moment. Again, we came across a big interest in the Asian markets. The attendees were extremely interested to know the specifics about that area’s average eCPMs and well-performing geos. Another trend we picked up on from the developers was the wish to have a tech support in the local language of the app and the developing companies ability to resolve issues more easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found many interesting new contacts and would recommend the event to everyone who wishes to acquire Russian customers &#8211; White Nights is the perfect place for it!</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last week of October led us to the city of lights! Paris hosted </span><a href="https://www.game-connection.com/"><b>Game Connection Europe</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; a conference that is the best known as “the deal making event” and our VP of Sales, Clemence Etienne represented our team there. This event is meant for developers, publishers, distributors and service providers, with that said the attendees&#8217; list is very diverse. The overall mix included companies offering development, different gaming related niche services and developers. Most of the attending developers were focusing more on Console, PC and Steam rather than on gaming apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the event is very professional and business oriented it is important to book meetings with people you wish to meet, as otherwise, you might not have a chance due to the pre-booked agendas. So, make sure that you plan and book your meetings beforehand! We were highly excited to meet our demand partners and we had a long and fruitful talk with the Mintegral team – we were very happy to see you! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game Connection is definitely one of the events that’s very useful to attend for any gaming related companies who wish to meet and do business with other key players. We are looking very much looking forward to their next event in San Fransisco in March 2019. </span></p>

					<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago we had the pleasure to visit the beautiful coastal capital of Finland – Helsinki! <strong>Pocket Gamer Connects</strong> conference was in town and held their biggest Helsinki event ever with Steel Media as the main sponsor. If you weren&#8217;t there then you don’t have to worry, we’ll be covering all the essentials in this post!</span></h6>
				</div>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6 et_pb_bg_layout_light  et_pb_text_align_left">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our company is still new, we are trying to do our best to have a presence at all the important industry events. <strong>PGC Helsinki</strong> was thus no different. The event had four rooms that hosted <strong>12</strong> tracks and more than <strong>120</strong> speakers, totaling up to <strong>1,325</strong> delegates from more than<strong> 600</strong> companies that represented <strong>49</strong> countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speakers covered many different topics throughout those 2 days from monetizer and developer toolkit tracks to game changers: hypercasual, trade trends, East meets West, blockchain basics, live ops landscape and more. The event was truly diverse and although <strong>mobile gaming</strong> still remains at the heart of the event there were many representatives from different fields such as blockchain games/platforms, PC, VR, AR, and handheld gaming consoles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day 1 included Unity’s monetizer track where they shared <strong>ad monetization tips</strong> from both</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ad networks’ and publishers’ side. Slava Taraskin and Jocelyn Shief from Unity Ads educated the publishers about how to grow their IAP revenue and increase retention through a live game performance optimization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big gaming studios (Playstack, Pixowl, Hatch, Creative Mobile, and HYPRMX) shared their experiences with <strong>ad optimization technologies</strong> and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">discussed both their failures and lessons learned. One common point that they brought out was the use of third-party mediation platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Claiming that mediation is great because:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there’s no need to reinvent the wheel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it meets the publishers’ needs and is easy to manage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows publishers to focus on developing their games </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the event highlights, the focus was very clearly on <strong>developers</strong>, both indie developers and medium to big app companies and in-app service providers. The event had lots of different engaging activities throughout the days. One of the highlights was definitely short mentoring sessions held by various game industry leaders who shared their valuable insights and expertise.</span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had the opportunity to meet with our network partners and our current customers. Our team also introduced our product to new and potential developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sum it all up, the atmosphere was perfect for sharing and gaining knowledge, doing business, networking and having fun with new and interesting people. </span></p>

					<h6>As more and more mobile solutions become available daily, there isn’t much you can’t do on a mobile device nowadays. So, it’s no surprise that when we look around us there are so many people who are constantly on their phones, tapping away. Thus, we decided to make a post about top tips for successful monetization, to make app publishers&#8217; lives a little easier.</h6>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p>The mobile ads industry is growing at a rapid speed, and honestly, seeing how people get most of their primary information from that one tiny device, clearly, mobile advertising is not something to be overlooked. The time that people spend on apps is only increasing. <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/eMarketer-Unveils-New-Estimates-Mobile-App-Usage/1015611">eMarketer</a> states that over <strong>20%</strong> of all media time and <strong>85%</strong> of mobile time is spent<strong> in-app</strong>, which is why the advertisers should take notice and spend much more time placing their ads on mobiles.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2018/02/23/mobile-advertising-will-drive-75-of-all-digital-ad-spend-in-2018-heres-whats-changing/#5add470758be">Forbes</a>, mobile advertising will drive 75% of all digital spend this year, and that’s in the U.S alone. Imagine then how big the global percentage would be. <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/its-time-for-brands-to-invest-more-in-mobile-advertising/">Adweek</a> shows that the trend is dominant in China as well, where the digital ad spend is 80/20 in favor of mobile ads and is set to increase in the following years.</p>
<p>As it is now clear how and why mobile advertising is important for advertisers, it is equally important for app publishers. Especially so, because the app economy will double by 2020 and the global revenue will reach the outstanding $101 billion according to <a href="https://monetizepros.com/mobile-monetization/the-ultimate-guide-to-mobile-app-monetization/">MonetizePros</a>. Since the majority of the apps are launched to generate revenue yet are still free apps, the developers need to find solutions on how to make revenue. Monetization through advertisements is a very effective way to generate it. Now is the part where the question “why?” appears. Well, advertising eliminates the cost barrier, thus the users don’t have to pay per download and are more likely to download your app, while you earn money from their activities within the app.</p>
<p>It is important to set up a monetization plan and to choose the best monetization model for your app, as that’s the crucial factor depending on which the app is either successful or not. The smart and time-saving solution is to use an app monetization platform, that way you can also reduce your operational costs. How does it work? The platform deals with the mediation of their platform and the top ad networks while optimizing your ads at the same time. This way you can focus on making your product better and at the same time earn revenue from the ads at the same time by letting the mediation platform do all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Here’s how you can monetize your app efficiently:</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>#1 Work across global partners</h6>
<p>The industry is packed with many in-app players yet you should always opt for the best ones (i.e Admob, Facebook, Applovin, etc.) in order to gain the best metrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>#2 Choose the right ad formats for your app users</strong></h6>
<p>Mobile users are spending most of their smartphone time in-app, which significantly exceeds the time spent in mobile browsers. That’s exactly why it is very important to choose the right and engaging ad format for your users. Banner, interstitial, video and rewarded video ads cover 95% of the global spending on in-app advertising. Appmediation offers all those top ad formats and provides consultancy to the app developers by positioning the right format inside their app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>#3 Generate higher engagement with interactive video and rewarded video ads </strong></h6>
<p>Video and rewarded video ads are the best monetization methods and deliver significantly higher performance than other ad formats. As the advertisements should be user-centric and display engaging content, video ads are proven to be the best way to do that. These formats help to increase user retention metrics, high user engagement rate and on average deliver 5-20 times higher performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>#4 Display your ads in a sustainable way </strong></h6>
<p>Make sure to display your ads in a way that they are integrated within your app flow and don’t influence the user experience in a negative way. It’s one of the most crucial points to follow, as intrusive ads that are not relevant to users can bring down the user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>#5 Using the right optimization levers</strong></h6>
<p>Choose a platform that provides extra options like prediction model, control waterfall model, bid floors to provide transparency and flexibility in optimizing performance. For example, Appmediation has an industry-leading optimization technology that chooses the most suitable ads for your audience while matching your inventory with the highest bidding network and thus maximizing your revenue. You save on resources while our technology takes care of the rest and without interrupting the user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>#6 Choose a platform that cares about their users </strong></h6>
<p>The users are in the center of the mobile industry, which is why the users’ ad experience is one of the most important aspects. If you are able to deliver the best UX, it increases (1) your chance to retain users for a long time, (2) your ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and gives you higher visibility in the app stores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, it is important to remember that when you’re monetizing your app then in addition to setting up your revenue goals, you also factor in the user experience and approach the strategy with having the app user in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>GDPR</strong> deadline is approaching fast and app developers need to make sure that they are compliant with the new regulations before the </span><b>25th May 2018.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We’re happy to announce that appmediation and all our demand partners are ready for GDPR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that user data is important to our developers’ values and operations. That is why we are taking measures to support our partners’ compliance with GDPR. To avoid any future hassle related to the new regulations, follow this article to find out how to collect end-users’ consent and make sure that your app is GDPR compliant.</span></p>
<h3><b>User Consent</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned in our updated </span><a href="https://appmediation.com/privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <strong>app developers need to obtain end-users’ consent from EU &amp; EEA users</strong> before using our advertising services and it is publishers’ responsibility to collect user consent on personal data collection.</span></p>
<h3><strong>New GDPR Compliant SDK </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help our publishers to meet the GDPR requirements, we have released our <strong>GDPR Compliant Android SDK Version 1.7.0</strong> and<strong> iOS SDK Version 1.8.0</strong> that has the ability to collect user consent. In order to make user consent collection easier for our publishers, our latest SDK supports two options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Consent Window</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Consent Function</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Consent Window</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have developed a </span><i>Consent Window </i><span style="font-weight: 400;">option to make it easier for our publishers to collect end-user consent for appmediation and our demand partners’ advertising services. Each time when you’re required to collect end-user data consent call <em>Consent Window</em>, more information about this function can be found </span><a href="https://appmediation.com/documentation/"><b>here.</b></a></p>
<p><strong>iOS &amp; Android Consent Notice Windows</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-48836" src="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS-169x300.png" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS-169x300.png 169w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS-576x1024.png 576w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS-610x1085.png 610w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" />    <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-48837" src="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-169x300.png" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-169x300.png 169w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-768x1365.png 768w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-576x1024.png 576w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-610x1084.png 610w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to user’s selection on<em> Consent Window</em>, we will show either personalized or non-personalized ads. If the user selects</span><b> NO</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then our partners will show non-personalized ads and if they choose</span> to <b>CONFIRM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then personalized ads will be shown which can boost up your app revenue.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Consent Function</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve already built a functionality to collect user consent then please just update to the latest </span><b>Android SDK 1.7.0 and iOS SDK 1.8.0. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest SDK version, we have a functionality to set user consent preferences and it&#8217;s highly recommended to set this method </span><b>before initializing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Appmediation SDK otherwise the SDK will initialize with the default “NO” which can lead to non-personalised ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consent Function</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consent Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be used together if needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Future Scenarios</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Can user withdraw their consent?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When EU &amp; EEA user don’t provide consent, we will still show an ad but it will be non-personalized.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Can user withdraw their consent?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the user can change consent at any time and appmediation will pass their updated consent to all demand partners.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If app developer/publisher is not collecting user consent and using latest appmediation GDPR compliant SDK?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then always pass user consent as</span><b> false for EU &amp; EEA </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">users before the appmediation’s latest SDK initialization.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If app developer/publisher is not collecting user consent and using appmediation’s non-GDPR compliant SDKs?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s absolutely </span><b>mandatory to collect user consent for EU &amp; EEA users. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using </span><b>appmediation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s non-GDPR compliant SDK and user consent is not present, then don’t intialize appmediation’s SDK as it’s against data protection regulations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 align="justify"><b>Questions?</b></h5>
<p align="justify">If you have any further questions about our latest SDK then please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us. We’ve also put together a helpful <a href="https://appmediation.com/faq/"><strong>FAQ</strong> </a>section to help you navigate GDPR and explain what it means.

					<p>We take the quality of our mediation platform and the service that we offer very seriously. This helps us show only the best and highest performing ads to your audiences. On the other side of this is, of course, keeping our publishers from being exposed to campaigns that are not relevant. For a personal ad filtering service, <a href="support@appmediation.com">drop an email to our support team</a>.</p>
<h2>How ad filtering works</h2>
<p>Most networks that we partner with have the option to filter ads as you see fit. This is where we come in as a mediation partner. We help you filter the ads that will be shown to the users of your apps. This way they will be matched with ads that suit them the best and they’re more likely to interact with. This also means, however, that you will also have control over what you don’t want them to see. For example, if you’re a game developer, you might want to filter out ads that promote your competition in this field. Essentially, this is a very good way to ensure that your app’s users see ads that are relevant for them, but align with your goals as well.</p>
<h2>Levels of filtering</h2>
<p>There’s a variety of options available based on which filtering can be done. Ads can be categorized and excluded based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Landing pages</li>
<li>App/play store URL</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Keyword</li>
</ul>
<p>We take some additional details into account as well to make sure the user experience flow is as seamless as possible. For example, if the user views the app in landscape, they will be matched with an ad that’s also in landscape.</p>
<h2>COPPA</h2>
<p>We are compliant with COPPA or the Children’s Online Privacy Policy Act. This restricts how and what can be marketed online to children under the age of 13 and we take it very seriously. This means that we filter ads accordingly to make sure that no unsuitable content is shown to young audiences.</p>
<h2>We’ve got the quality</h2>
<p>As an <strong>appmediation</strong> publisher you will get access to a wide selection of exclusive partner networks that want to show ads to your users. We provide mediation for top level advertising campaigns from premium brands with quality content. However, we have the filtering option to further fine-tune the suitability of the ads with the app’s content. Also, don’t hesitate to reach out to our team if you happen to see any ads that do not match your expectations.</p>

					<p>We’ve created an easy way to access the performance data on our dashboard without you even needing to log in. That’s right, we’ve just launched the <strong>reporting </strong><strong>API</strong> to make it even more convenient to retrieve all the information from our dashboard for analysis. The API will let you tap directly into our reporting feature and get all the performance data that you need. This will make assessing the performance of the networks you’ve chosen to partner with even more comfortable.</p>
<h4>How to set up the reporting API</h4>
<p>It’s really very easy and only just requires two steps. First you need to get the API key from the <strong>appmediation</strong> dashboard and then use the key in an endpoint URL to fetch the data. That’s basically it, you’re all set.</p>
<h4>Available metrics in reporting data</h4>
<p>There’s a variety of metrics available in the report to make for a clear and transparent analysis. Here’s what you can fetch via the reporting API:</p>
<ul>

					<p>We recently mentioned on our blog that we have a Chrome extension for AdMob available. The extension lets you synchronize data from our dashboard with your AdMob account. You can get the extension for free <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appmediation/njldkgmcmlcdhhjifhlllpoejfgconci">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve put together a little walk through to help you set up the extension. Trust us, it’s super easy and won’t take long. (Pro tip: you can also scroll directly to the bottom of the post and check out our video tutorial.)</p>
<p>So, basically you start from registering your app on the appmediation platform and setting up your account. To be able to set up the sync, make sure that you’ve chosen AdMob as one of the partner networks you’re looking to work with. Once you’re on the My Apps page on our dashboard, there’ll be an icon asking you to sync with AdMob. From there you’ll be taken to the integration page from where you can download the Chrome extension. <strong>Important:</strong> make sure that your adblock is switched off, otherwise the sync will not happen.</p>
<p>Now it’ll only be three more steps to having everything up and running. First log in to our dashboard and enable AdMob reporting. Then choose the Google account you wish to use for this synchronisation and log in. This will automatically enable the AdSense API, but just in case we advise you to be patient &#8211; it may take a few moments before everything is ready. Make sure you give permission where needed, otherwise the sync will not happen. And now the only thing left is to complete the third step: open the browser extension and click on the sync button.</p>
<p>That’s it! You’re done! And your AdMob Chrome extension for appmediation should now be running smoothly.</p>

					<p>When we say MWC, we are, of course, talking about #MWC2018 aka <a href="https://www.mobileworldcongress.com/">Mobile World Congress 2018</a>. This year&#8217;s event was a bit of a milestone for us. You see, it was the first big industry event we attended and we had the pleasure to exhibit there together with our sister company Adcash.</p>

					<p>We had a really great time getting together with everyone who had booked a personal meeting with our team, but also each and every person who just came by our booth or attended our happy hour! (Btw, keep an eye on our website as a future reference, because we’ll be going to more events and you can always book meetings in advance with our team members!)</p>

					<p>So what happened at MWC? It was a whirlwind of a week! According to the GSMA official stats, more than 100 000 people attended the event from over 205 countries. We were one among the 2 400 exhibitors! It was great to see such an interest in us &#8211; our booth was constantly packed with visitors. We were part of the official Mobile Advertising and Apps Tour with Clemence, our VP of Sales, giving presentations about appmediation. We even received visits from the current European Commission VP for the Digital Single Market and the Estonian Minister of Entrepreneurship and IT!</p>

					<p>We’ve been working hard and making deals to expand our network of demand partners. Of course, we aim to connect our app publishers with as many major and premium partners as we can possibly find. That’s an ongoing process &#8211; we simply never rest!</p>
<h3>Efficiency in transparency</h3>
<p>We’re not shy about who we work with. Quite the opposite, in fact. Our top quality demand network is the result of dedicated effort. We openly disclose all our demand partners on our website and, naturally, notify every time we have added a new batch. But that’s not all. Our publishers can see all the partners and how they are bidding on the reporting level as well. This kind of transparency means that our publishers can choose who they work with and essentially have a higher chance to earn more as well.</p>
<h3>Our partners</h3>
<p>So, who do we work with exactly? Feast your eyes on the latest list of the demand networks that we work with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook Audience Network</li>
<li>AdMob*</li>
<li>AdColony</li>
<li>Applovin</li>
<li>Tapjoy</li>
<li>Vungle</li>
<li>Chartboost</li>
<li>Unity ads</li>
<li>Inmobi</li>
<li>Mintegral</li>
<li>Ogury</li>
<li>StartApp</li>
<li>myTarget</li>
</ul>
<p>*We even have a shiny new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appmediation/njldkgmcmlcdhhjifhlllpoejfgconci?hl=en-US">Chrome extension</a> in place for synchronizing AdMob applications with <strong>appmediation</strong>.</p>
<p>As you can see, we have established ourselves well in the American, European and Middle Eastern markets. We are currently also putting a serious focus into building relationships with Asian and Russian players. According to our Managing Director Sushant Patil, the <strong>appmediation</strong> direction is to clearly strive for full world-wide coverage: “Our team is constantly working on striking deals with new and diverse demand partners to build a truly international network. At the same time we are also continuously onboarding app publishers with very different products and inventory.”</p>
<h3>Diversity of demand</h3>
<p>When we speak of diversity we don’t only mean geographical reach. We’re also talking about different types of content with very specific audiences. While have demand from networks with diverse advertising needs, we also work with all kinds of apps. We are COPPA compliant and we also employ the mature filter, which means that we honour all app attributes.</p>
<p>We’ve mentioned numerous times by now that we are hungry for accomplishments and not ones to take it easy. So it’s not really too surprising that we’re also working on some major technical developments. Stay tuned because we’ll be launching our news soon and we want you to be the first to find out!</p>
