Failure to meet the conditions set forward may result in account suspension or termination.</p>
<p>5. ADVERTISEMENT PLACEMENT POLICY</p>
<p>You are welcome to place the ads on any Publisher Applications in compliance with our policies. Multiple Advertising Spaces can help optimize your performance by leveraging Appmediation’s large inventory of ads. You can put different Appmediation advertisement formats per page.</p>
<p>During Appmediation’ initial check period of your App submission the Advertising Space might display a blank space (no content).</p>
<p>Any content will be displayed on the Advertising Space after the submission is approved.</p>
<p>Altering or manipulating the behaviour, targeting, appearance or delivery of ads without explicit approval from Appmediation is generally prohibited and may result in punitive actions that include but are not limited to discarding the impressions impacted and/or blocking the account.</p>
<p>5.1. MISLEADING CONTENT</p>
<p>It is important that users of your Application are not misled in any way and are able to easily distinguish content from ads. This policy prohibits placing ads under misleading headings or titles. Because ads in such a position might be mistaken for links or listings instead of advertisements, such an implementation is considered unacceptable. Monitor your Application and its layout carefully to ensure this does not happen. It is important not to encourage Internet users directly or indirectly to click Appmediation Advertisers’ ads. To avoid this issue, you are required to use only “sponsored links” or “advertisements” to label any ads.</p>
<p>5.2. APPLICATIONS WITH POP-UPs</p>
<p>Note that if pop-ups are displayed in application, they may not interfere with the navigation, change user preferences, initiate downloads, or distribute viruses. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT NO AD NETWORK OR AFFILIATE OR ANY OTHER USER USES SUCH METHODS TO DIRECT TRAFFIC TO APPLICATIONS THAT CONTAIN YOUR APPMEDIATION ADVERTISEMENT SDK.</p>
<p>5.3. COMMON ADVERTISEMENT PLACEMENT</p>
<p>You are welcome to display Appmediation Advertisers’ ads on the same application as other third party advertisements provided that the formatting or colors of the third party ads is different enough from that of the Appmediation ads. In other words, if you choose to place non-Appmediation ads on the same application as Appmediation ads, it should always be clear to the user that these ads are served by different advertising networks and that the non-Appmediation ads have no association with Appmediation. Please also be aware that competitor ads are considered to be part of your Application content and must follow our quality agreement and advertisement placement policy.</p>
<p>5.4. NOT SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS</p>
<p>You will be credited for all earning that are made through your SDK. If you wish to use Appmediation Advertisers’ ads on a application not associated with your Appmediation Account, you will have to make sure that this unregistered application is in compliance with our quality agreement and advertisement placement policy. If not owned by you, you need to get permission from the owner of the application to display ads on their application. You may place your SDK along with the other Publisher’s SDK-s on the same page. In addition, be aware that every Publisher is responsible for the content on which their SDK is placed. You agree that you are responsible for monitoring each application, whether registered under your Appmediation Account or not, where your Appmediation SDK appear. If a Publisher application is found in violation of Contract, we may take actions against any Publisher(s) whose ASDK is used. You agree that we might ask you to remove the Appmediation SDK from unregistered applications partly or fully for whatever reasons. Please note that when you use SDK on the same applications as other Publishers, you will still only be credited for these earnings that were made through the SDK belonging to your own Appmediation Account. In other words, if the Application includes SDK from different Publishers, each of them will be credited independently.</p>
<p>5.5. HOSTED APPLICATIONS</p>
<p>You are welcome to place Appmediation SDK on any application, which comply with Contract, including hosted applications. However, please be aware that in order to use Appmediation services, you’ll need to have access to your applications’s source code.

<p>You are welcome to place Appmediation Advertisers’ ads on password-protected applications as long as those applications comply with Contract. When submitting application, please make sure to provide Appmediation with a non-password-protected page for review. If your applications require a login and irrelevant ads are appearing, we may ask you to provide us a demo account to access protected pages.</p>
<p>5.7. MOBILE SDK</p>
<p>You may use the Appmediation mobile SDK (software development kits) only for the purposes set forth in this contract. Should you use the SDK to develop applications for the use of the general public, you agree to protect the privacy and rights of these users. You agree and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any content or resources that you create, transmit or display through the application. In order to use the Appmediation SDK, you must have an active Appmediation Account.</p>
<p>5.8. AD EXCHANGE</p>
<p>You are welcome to place Advertisement SDK on third-party platforms including RTB Ad exchanges and media networks, which comply with the Contract.
