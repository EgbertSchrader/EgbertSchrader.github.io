					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>GDPR</strong> deadline is approaching fast and app developers need to make sure that they are compliant with the new regulations before the </span><b>25th May 2018.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We’re happy to announce that appmediation and all our demand partners are ready for GDPR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that user data is important to our developers’ values and operations. That is why we are taking measures to support our partners’ compliance with GDPR. To avoid any future hassle related to the new regulations, follow this article to find out how to collect end-users’ consent and make sure that your app is GDPR compliant.</span></p>
<h3><b>User Consent</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned in our updated </span><a href="https://appmediation.com/privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <strong>app developers need to obtain end-users’ consent from EU &amp; EEA users</strong> before using our advertising services and it is publishers’ responsibility to collect user consent on personal data collection.</span></p>
<h3><strong>New GDPR Compliant SDK </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help our publishers to meet the GDPR requirements, we have released our <strong>GDPR Compliant Android SDK Version 1.7.0</strong> and<strong> iOS SDK Version 1.8.0</strong> that has the ability to collect user consent. In order to make user consent collection easier for our publishers, our latest SDK supports two options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Consent Window</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Consent Function</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Consent Window</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have developed a </span><i>Consent Window </i><span style="font-weight: 400;">option to make it easier for our publishers to collect end-user consent for appmediation and our demand partners’ advertising services. Each time when you’re required to collect end-user data consent call <em>Consent Window</em>, more information about this function can be found </span><a href="https://appmediation.com/documentation/"><b>here.</b></a></p>
<p><strong>iOS &amp; Android Consent Notice Windows</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-48836" src="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS-169x300.png" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS-169x300.png 169w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS-576x1024.png 576w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS-610x1085.png 610w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/iOS.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" />    <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-48837" src="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-169x300.png" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-169x300.png 169w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-768x1365.png 768w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-576x1024.png 576w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1-610x1084.png 610w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/android-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to user’s selection on<em> Consent Window</em>, we will show either personalized or non-personalized ads. If the user selects</span><b> NO</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then our partners will show non-personalized ads and if they choose</span> to <b>CONFIRM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then personalized ads will be shown which can boost up your app revenue.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Consent Function</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve already built a functionality to collect user consent then please just update to the latest </span><b>Android SDK 1.7.0 and iOS SDK 1.8.0. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest SDK version, we have a functionality to set user consent preferences and it&#8217;s highly recommended to set this method </span><b>before initializing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Appmediation SDK otherwise the SDK will initialize with the default “NO” which can lead to non-personalised ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consent Function</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consent Window</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be used together if needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Future Scenarios</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Can user withdraw their consent?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When EU &amp; EEA user don’t provide consent, we will still show an ad but it will be non-personalized.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Can user withdraw their consent?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the user can change consent at any time and appmediation will pass their updated consent to all demand partners.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If app developer/publisher is not collecting user consent and using latest appmediation GDPR compliant SDK?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then always pass user consent as</span><b> false for EU &amp; EEA </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">users before the appmediation’s latest SDK initialization.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If app developer/publisher is not collecting user consent and using appmediation’s non-GDPR compliant SDKs?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s absolutely </span><b>mandatory to collect user consent for EU &amp; EEA users. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using </span><b>appmediation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s non-GDPR compliant SDK and user consent is not present, then don’t intialize appmediation’s SDK as it’s against data protection regulations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 align="justify"><b>Questions?</b></h5>
<p align="justify">If you have any further questions about our latest SDK then please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us. We’ve also put together a helpful <a href="https://appmediation.com/faq/"><strong>FAQ</strong> </a>section to help you navigate GDPR and explain what it means. However, if you have any additional privacy-related questions, feel free to contact <a title="support@appmediation.com" href="mailto:support@appmediation.com?subject=" target="_self"><span style="color: #cc3366;">support@appmediation.com</span></a></p>

					<p>We take the quality of our mediation platform and the service that we offer very seriously. This helps us show only the best and highest performing ads to your audiences. On the other side of this is, of course, keeping our publishers from being exposed to campaigns that are not relevant. For a personal ad filtering service, <a href="support@appmediation.com">drop an email to our support team</a>.</p>
<h2>How ad filtering works</h2>
<p>Most networks that we partner with have the option to filter ads as you see fit. This is where we come in as a mediation partner. We help you filter the ads that will be shown to the users of your apps. This way they will be matched with ads that suit them the best and they’re more likely to interact with. This also means, however, that you will also have control over what you don’t want them to see. For example, if you’re a game developer, you might want to filter out ads that promote your competition in this field. Essentially, this is a very good way to ensure that your app’s users see ads that are relevant for them, but align with your goals as well.</p>
<h2>Levels of filtering</h2>
<p>There’s a variety of options available based on which filtering can be done. Ads can be categorized and excluded based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Landing pages</li>
<li>App/play store URL</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Keyword</li>
</ul>
<p>We take some additional details into account as well to make sure the user experience flow is as seamless as possible. For example, if the user views the app in landscape, they will be matched with an ad that’s also in landscape.</p>
<h2>COPPA</h2>
<p>We are compliant with COPPA or the Children’s Online Privacy Policy Act. This restricts how and what can be marketed online to children under the age of 13 and we take it very seriously. This means that we filter ads accordingly to make sure that no unsuitable content is shown to young audiences.</p>
<h2>We’ve got the quality</h2>
<p>As an <strong>appmediation</strong> publisher you will get access to a wide selection of exclusive partner networks that want to show ads to your users. We provide mediation for top level advertising campaigns from premium brands with quality content. However, we have the filtering option to further fine-tune the suitability of the ads with the app’s content. Also, don’t hesitate to reach out to our team if you happen to see any ads that do not match your expectations.</p>

					<p>We’ve created an easy way to access the performance data on our dashboard without you even needing to log in. That’s right, we’ve just launched the <strong>reporting </strong><strong>API</strong> to make it even more convenient to retrieve all the information from our dashboard for analysis. The API will let you tap directly into our reporting feature and get all the performance data that you need. This will make assessing the performance of the networks you’ve chosen to partner with even more comfortable.</p>
<h4>How to set up the reporting API</h4>
<p>It’s really very easy and only just requires two steps. First you need to get the API key from the <strong>appmediation</strong> dashboard and then use the key in an endpoint URL to fetch the data. That’s basically it, you’re all set.</p>
<h4>Available metrics in reporting data</h4>
<p>There’s a variety of metrics available in the report to make for a clear and transparent analysis. Here’s what you can fetch via the reporting API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requests</li>
<li>Network requests</li>
<li>Impressions served</li>
<li>Visible impressions</li>
<li>Clicks and earnings</li>
</ul>
<p>This data can also be grouped and filtered by:</p>
<ul>
<li>date,</li>
<li>bundleID,</li>
<li>app name,</li>
<li>platform,</li>
<li>adformat,</li>
<li>ad network,</li>
<li>country.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you set up our reporting API, we’ve put detailed guidelines on our <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/appmediation/Appmediation%20Publisher%20Reporting%20API%20v1.0.pdf"><strong>support knowledge base</strong></a>. Just walk through the steps and you’ll set up the reporting API in no time.</p>

					<p>We recently mentioned on our blog that we have a Chrome extension for AdMob available. The extension lets you synchronize data from our dashboard with your AdMob account. You can get the extension for free <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appmediation/njldkgmcmlcdhhjifhlllpoejfgconci">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve put together a little walk through to help you set up the extension. Trust us, it’s super easy and won’t take long. (Pro tip: you can also scroll directly to the bottom of the post and check out our video tutorial.)</p>
<p>So, basically you start from registering your app on the appmediation platform and setting up your account. To be able to set up the sync, make sure that you’ve chosen AdMob as one of the partner networks you’re looking to work with. Once you’re on the My Apps page on our dashboard, there’ll be an icon asking you to sync with AdMob. From there you’ll be taken to the integration page from where you can download the Chrome extension. <strong>Important:</strong> make sure that your adblock is switched off, otherwise the sync will not happen.</p>
<p>Now it’ll only be three more steps to having everything up and running. First log in to our dashboard and enable AdMob reporting. Then choose the Google account you wish to use for this synchronisation and log in. This will automatically enable the AdSense API, but just in case we advise you to be patient &#8211; it may take a few moments before everything is ready. Make sure you give permission where needed, otherwise the sync will not happen. And now the only thing left is to complete the third step: open the browser extension and click on the sync button.</p>
<p>That’s it! You’re done! And your AdMob Chrome extension for appmediation should now be running smoothly.</p>

					<p>So what happened at MWC? It was a whirlwind of a week! According to the GSMA official stats, more than 100 000 people attended the event from over 205 countries. We were one among the 2 400 exhibitors! It was great to see such an interest in us &#8211; our booth was constantly packed with visitors. We were part of the official Mobile Advertising and Apps Tour with Clemence, our VP of Sales, giving presentations about appmediation. We even received visits from the current European Commission VP for the Digital Single Market and the Estonian Minister of Entrepreneurship and IT!</p>

					<p>We’ve been working hard and making deals to expand our network of demand partners. Of course, we aim to connect our app publishers with as many major and premium partners as we can possibly find. That’s an ongoing process &#8211; we simply never rest!</p>
<h3>Efficiency in transparency</h3>
<p>We’re not shy about who we work with. Quite the opposite, in fact. Our top quality demand network is the result of dedicated effort. We openly disclose all our demand partners on our website and, naturally, notify every time we have added a new batch. But that’s not all. Our publishers can see all the partners and how they are bidding on the reporting level as well. This kind of transparency means that our publishers can choose who they work with and essentially have a higher chance to earn more as well.</p>
<h3>Our partners</h3>
<p>So, who do we work with exactly? Feast your eyes on the latest list of the demand networks that we work with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook Audience Network</li>
<li>AdMob*</li>
<li>AdColony</li>
<li>Applovin</li>
<li>Tapjoy</li>
<li>Vungle</li>
<li>Chartboost</li>
<li>Unity ads</li>
<li>Inmobi</li>
<li>Mintegral</li>
<li>Ogury</li>
<li>StartApp</li>
<li>myTarget</li>
</ul>
<p>*We even have a shiny new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appmediation/njldkgmcmlcdhhjifhlllpoejfgconci?hl=en-US">Chrome extension</a> in place for synchronizing AdMob applications with <strong>appmediation</strong>.</p>
<p>As you can see, we have established ourselves well in the American, European and Middle Eastern markets. We are currently also putting a serious focus into building relationships with Asian and Russian players. According to our Managing Director Sushant Patil, the <strong>appmediation</strong> direction is to clearly strive for full world-wide coverage: “Our team is constantly working on striking deals with new and diverse demand partners to build a truly international network. At the same time we are also continuously onboarding app publishers with very different products and inventory.”</p>
<h3>Diversity of demand</h3>
<p>When we speak of diversity we don’t only mean geographical reach. We’re also talking about different types of content with very specific audiences. While have demand from networks with diverse advertising needs, we also work with all kinds of apps. We are COPPA compliant and we also employ the mature filter, which means that we honour all app attributes.</p>
<p>We’ve mentioned numerous times by now that we are hungry for accomplishments and not ones to take it easy. So it’s not really too surprising that we’re also working on some major technical developments. Stay tuned because we’ll be launching our news soon and we want you to be the first to find out!</p>

					<p>We’ve all heard the saying that there’s strength in numbers. We at <strong>appmediation</strong> have decided to give that statement a bit of a facelift &#8211; we believe that there is strength in <strong>data.</strong> And in order to empower our publishers and give them all the data they need, we’ve recently added a new statistic dimension to the <strong>appmediation</strong> publisher dashboard. Some of our more eagle-eyed users may have already noticed this feature &#8211; there is now information about <strong>view rate percentage</strong> on our dashboard as well.</p>
<p>This update is all about giving our publishers an even more deeper level of statistics and metrics to analyze. That’s one of the unique things about the <strong>appmediation</strong> dashboard &#8211; our publishers have clear and easy access to all the important information they might need directly on the platform itself.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-48373" src="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-30-at-11.41.58-1024x289.png" alt="" width="1024" height="289" srcset="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-30-at-11.41.58-1024x289.png 1024w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-30-at-11.41.58-300x85.png 300w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-30-at-11.41.58-768x217.png 768w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-30-at-11.41.58-610x172.png 610w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-30-at-11.41.58-1080x305.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>What is view rate?</h3>
<p>In short, the view rate percentage shows the proportion between the times an ad is being engaged with and the times it has been served. The formula is very simple &#8211; it is literally the number of views or engagements divided by the number of times the ad is served. Essentially the view rate percentage can give some very important information about the ads themselves. For example, how effective is the content, is the placement of ads logical or can they be served within context where they could attract a higher engagement.</p>
<h3>The appmediation metrics dashboard</h3>
<p>The dashboard is incredibly easy to navigate, which means that all metrics-related information is very conveniently accessible and clear. The dashboard itself contains an overview of other metrics as well. It also shows you the number of impressions, fill rate percentage, clicks, the click-through rate, revenue and eCPM.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-48374" src="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pasted-image-0-1024x202.png" alt="" width="1024" height="202" srcset="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pasted-image-0-1024x202.png 1024w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pasted-image-0-300x59.png 300w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pasted-image-0-768x152.png 768w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pasted-image-0-610x120.png 610w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pasted-image-0-1080x213.png 1080w, https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pasted-image-0.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>All the information on the dashboard is also downloadable with just one click, should you wish to keep this data in your own record for longevity or further analysis.</p>
<p>This new statistical information on the dashboard is related to our recent SDK updates. We have updated the <strong>Android SDK to version 1.2.0 and iOS SDK to version 1.4.0.</strong></p>
<p>We at <strong>appmediation</strong> believe in being transparent and open with our publishers. That’s why we invest time and effort into keeping our dashboard updated with the most relevant dimensions in metrics. If you’re an app publisher and not already signed up with us &#8211; wait no more!</p>

					<p>Let’s start with the importance of mobile advertising in general. By now it’s pretty clear how much of the users’ lives really happen on the mobile. We have countless ways to consume products and information and make transactions. <a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/marketers-need-to-stop-looking-at-mobile-as-a-channel-its-a-lifestyle/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdWeek</a> recently published an article stating that “mobile is not a channel, but a lifestyle”. We couldn’t agree more. It’s not really a surprise then that mobile advertising is also reaching new heights and tapping into new avenues. After all, the prognosis is that mobile advertising will account for <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Will-Account-72-of-US-Digital-Ad-Spend-by-2019/1012258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">72% of all ad spend by 2019</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do you as an app developer fit into this puzzle?</strong> You have an app and you start looking into possible ways to generate more revenue. Of course, at the same time you also want to ensure a high quality product for your users with minimal disruption to their user experience. A good solution is to find a mediation partner that best suits your needs.</p>
<p><strong>So what is mediation?</strong> To put it simply, it’s a way for app developers to harness the money-making power of their inventory. By joining a mediation platform and integrating the service’s SDK, you allow a number of networks to compete at the same time for the chance to display different ads to the users of your app.</p>
<p><strong>Now, why choose appmediation as your mediation partner?</strong> Our SDK and mediation platform are designed based on extensive experience in the industry &#8211; we have a pretty good idea of what works and how to create a service that is an especially good fit for app developers.</p>
<p>Our SDK is super lightweight and it can be easily integrated &#8211; you just set everything up once and there’s no need for separate updates or any kind of additional management. This single easy SDK opens up a wide network of demand partners that will compete for your inventory in real time. A single SDK means that your app’s performance is in no way held back by your mediation partner &#8211; with us you’re completely safe from SDK bloat. At the same time you have access to a wide network of demand partners that have need for different types of inventory &#8211; our demand network already has some well-established players in the advertising industry, but we are also constantly growing. A wide demand combined with precise targeting means that your traffic will only be seeing the most relevant ads, which is <strong>the perfect way to truly maximise your fill rate. </strong></p>
<p>The appmediation <strong>smart dashboard</strong> gives our publishers full control over their inventory &#8211; you decide which ad formats and when your users see. We believe in engaging and uninterrupted user experience, which is why our publishers have this unique feature &#8211; you choose which formats are displayed to best suit the app’s flow. Our platform is also fully transparent, we have a unified reporting tool to make sure you can keep track of every detail.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s quickly talk about smart optimization as well!</strong> Our platform relies on smart real-time optimization technology. This is a feature specifically designed to boost your earnings. What it does is make sure that each and <strong>every impression is sent only to the highest bidder! </strong></p>
